title: "Decentralization and Program Implementation - Research Asistant"
description: Worked as a research assistant under Dr. Ashwini Deshpande to study the impact of district splits on the effectiveness of Program implementation. I prepared the dataset of over 800 districts and 7000 blocks using web scraping and census datasets. I identified district splits in India from 2011-20 by mapping block level changes in a district year over year, allowing us to study how district splits affected NREGA implementation in India from 2010-20.
