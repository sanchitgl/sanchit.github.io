title: "Words matter: Gender, Jobs and Applicant Behaviour - Research Asistant"
description: Worked as a research assistant under Dr. Kanika Mahajan to examine how implicit gender preference in Job ads leads to differential labor market outcomes. I used NLP techniques like tf-idf, topic modeling and word clouds to understand the differences between the kind of jobs offered and the keywords associated with respective gender preferred jobs.
