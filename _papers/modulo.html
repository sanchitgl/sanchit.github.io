description: Worked as a research assistant on the paper Words matter: Gender, Jobs and Applicant Behaviour, to examine how implicit gender preference in Job ads leads to differential labor market out- comes. I used NLP techniques like tf-idf, topic modeling and word clouds to understand the difference between the kind of jobs offered and the keywords associated with respective gender preferred jobs.
