title: "Words matter: Gender, Jobs and Applicant Behaviour  - Research Assistant"
description: Worked as a research assistant on the paper ‘Words matter: Gender, Jobs and Applicant Behaviour’, to examine how implicit gender preference in Job ads leads to differential labor market out- comes. I used NLP techniques like tf-idf, topic modeling and word clouds to understand the difference between the kind of jobs offered and the keywords associated with respective gender preferred jobs.
